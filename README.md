# Tab-Reader-Project

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to create an interpreter for standard 6 string tablature.

## Phase 1
Basic interpretation where the number of _ characters represents the
string number preceding the fret number on that particular string. For
now, using the _ character will suffice since we are not worried about
time efficiency on a large scale.

input 

0__2 

output

6 0

4 2

## Phase 2
Interpreter should be able to distinguish separate notes to emulate
basic timing.

input

0 000 000

output

6 0
<br /><br />

6 0

6 0

6 0
<br /><br />

6 0

6 0

## Phase 3
Interpreter should be able to distinguish single notes from chords.
Chords have the representation NOTE_1 | NOTE_2 ... | NOTE_N.

input

0^_2^__2 3^_5^__5

output

6 0 | 5 2 | 4 2
<br /><br />

6 3 | 5 5 | 4 5

## Phase 4
Interpreter should be able to recognize sequences of notes to be
repeated a specified amount of times. This functionality should have
the form /SEQUENCE_OF_NOTES*NUMBER_TO_REPEAT/ for non-nested repeats.

input

0 /000 *2/

output

6 0

## Phase 5
Let us introduce some commonly used techniques in guitar playing. The
character 'v' represents hammer-ons and '>' represents slides.

input

2>6>1

output

6 2 > 6 6 > 6 1

input

2v6v1

output

6 2 v 6 6 v 6 1

## Phase 6 
Notice that our interpreter so far only supports single digit notes.
As a resolution, we can introduce a union operator to distinguish single
digit notes from two-digit notes, '.'.

input

1.2__1.3

output

6 12 <br /><br />
4 13

## Phase 7
Let us introduce notation for palm-muting (x).

input

0x

output

6 0 (x)
